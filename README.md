Since the analyzed benchmark £¨dacapo.jar£©with instrumentations is large and exceeds the maxium size of one file allowed by git, we put it on skyDrive and you can access it through http://sdrv.ms/19Lb5IP.

You can run the instrumented DayTrader application as the steps the Dacapo benchmark tells you(http://www.dacapobench.org/). The results will be output into a txt file (e.g., E:\\console.txt).
